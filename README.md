Go functional programming

## Compile Go SDK

Generics will be added to go, but they are not yet supported. There is a tool that can be used to try out generics: go2go.

Clone the Go SDK:

```bash
$ git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go goroot
```

Check out the dev.go2go branch:

```bash
$ cd goroot
$ git checkout dev.go2go
```

Go to the `src` directory and compile everything:

```bash
$ cd src
$ ./all.bash
```

This will take some time.

## Configue GoLand
